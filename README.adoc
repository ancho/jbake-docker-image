= jbake docker image

Docker Image for JBake

Uses the official openjdk:8-alpine image to build a version of JBake and openjdk:8-jre-alpine for runtime.
The jbake submodule is pinned at the latest version tag.

== build

----
git submodule update
docker build -t jbake-org/jbake .
----

== change version

Lets say you want to build a version from master.

----
cd jbake
git checkout master
cd ..
----

You can now run the build again.
If the submodule should point to that specific commit add it with `git commit -a`
